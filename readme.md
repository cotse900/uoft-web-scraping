# U of T quick facts

- This is a project on scraping an html file with the example of [University of Toronto's quick facts](https://www.utoronto.ca/about-u-of-t/quick-facts).
- First, I obtained some raw html texts. Then, I extracted info based on how the web page was organized, and obtained texts and figures for further analysis or organization.
